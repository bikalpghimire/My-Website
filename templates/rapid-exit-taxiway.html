        <h5 class="text-muted">Airport Design</h5>
        <hr>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Concept and detailed design of Bravo and Charlie Rapid Exit Taxiways to reduce runway occupancy time and improve airside capacity. 
          Design aligned with ICAO Annexes and FAA Advisory Circulars, considering local operational constraints.</p>
        <h3 class="mt-4">Key Responsibilities & Contribution</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Optimized location of Rapid Exit Taxiway (RET) using REDIM and created data visualizations of simulation results using Python.</li>
          <li>Coordinated with ATC and pilots to validate preferred exits and for peak‑hour operations.</li>
          <li>Built swept‑path analysis in Autodesk Vehicle Tracking for fillet study and flight movement pattern.</li>
          <li>Prepared plan/profile, grading transitions, and typical sections in Civil 3D; coordinated with pavement and geotechnical teams.</li>
          <li>Outlined construction notes, staging concepts, and safety phasing to minimize runway closures.</li>
        </ul>
